A comparative analysis of how Wikipedia covered major news events in 2014. Read the [blog post here](http://www.brianckeegan.com/2014/12/the-news-on-wikipedia-in-2014/).

Edits to articles about these news events show very bursty patterns.

But these bursts in attention and revisions appear to be tightly correlated.

In addition to comparing the evolution of these articles, the analysis also looks at the structure of users' contributions to articles.
